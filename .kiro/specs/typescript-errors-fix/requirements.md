# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical TypeScript compilation errors across multiple files in the project. The errors include syntax issues, missing imports, type mismatches, and incorrect API usage. Fixing these errors is essential for maintaining code quality, enabling proper IDE support, and ensuring the application builds successfully.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all JavaScript/TypeScript files to have correct syntax, so that the project compiles without syntax errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is built THEN there SHALL be no syntax errors in any JavaScript or TypeScript files
2. WHEN `test-nextjs-mysql.js` is parsed THEN it SHALL have proper string literal termination and comma placement
3. WHEN any script file is executed THEN it SHALL not fail due to syntax errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all imports to resolve correctly, so that components can access their dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `AuthStatus.tsx` imports from `lucide-react` THEN it SHALL only import existing exported members
2. WHEN any component imports external libraries THEN the imports SHALL reference valid exports
3. WHEN the TypeScript compiler checks imports THEN there SHALL be no "Module has no exported member" errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want component props to match their type definitions, so that TypeScript can provide proper type checking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Badge components are used THEN their props SHALL match the BadgeProps interface
2. WHEN variant props are passed to Badge components THEN they SHALL use valid variant values
3. WHEN TypeScript checks component usage THEN there SHALL be no type assignment errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Active Directory service functions to use correct types, so that authentication operations work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Active Directory service uses LDAP client THEN it SHALL properly import and type the Client class
2. WHEN JWT tokens are signed THEN the signing options SHALL match the expected SignOptions interface
3. WHEN TypeScript checks the Active Directory service THEN there SHALL be no type errors or missing type definitions
